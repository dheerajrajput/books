What is structured programming?
Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control. That menas control should not leave from the middle of a function
to another function, like using a goto statement.

It is this ability to create falsifiable units of programming that makes structured programming valuable today. 
This is the reason that modern languages do not typically support unrestrained goto statements. 
Moreover, at the architectural level,
this is why we still consider functional decomposition to be one of our best practices.
